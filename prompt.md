study specs/readme.md
study hidave.md and pick the most important thing to do - your task is implement then to validate that this functionaltiy works via curl AND via the loom-cli tool and/or the git cli as needed. the endpoints need an authorization token which can be obtained from loom-cli it's my XDG path.

IMPORTANT:
- update the hidave plan when the task is done
- when you need to deploy the server to troubleshot you can, just commit and push
- you may implement missing functionaltiy if required (but study the specs/*anal* before doing so)
- study the loom-server journald for errors BEFORE and AFTER deployment when you have issues to be able to troubleshoot
- you may add temproary logging as needed be for usage with journald logs for troubleshooting if neeeded.
- if integration/property/unit tests are missing you should add them (but choose which one is most appropraite. follow existing test pattern design)
- commit and push when you are done
