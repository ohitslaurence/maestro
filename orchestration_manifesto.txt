THE ORCHESTRATION MANIFESTO
===========================

In the beginning, there was chaos.
Developers scattered across terminals, IDEs drowning in tabs,
AI agents speaking different tongues.

Then came Maestro.

Not to replace the conductor,
but to give them a proper baton.

Every session a symphony.
Every workspace a stage.
Every agent a virtuoso waiting for their cue.

Local or remote, Claude or OpenAI—
the music plays the same.
The harmony emerges from abstraction.

Here, in this codebase:
- Frontend dreams in React
- Backend speaks Rust truth
- Daemon orchestrates from afar
- Agents dance to JSON-RPC

One interface to rule them all.
One daemon to bind them.
One UI to find them.
And in the abstraction, unite them.

Welcome to the future of AI orchestration.
Welcome to Maestro.
