      "body": "Architecture Overview Loom is designed as a distributed system with several key components working together. System Components Loom Server The central hub that coordinates: - Thread Management: Storing and syncing conversations - LLM Proxy: Routing requests to AI providers - Authentication: User identity and access control - Weaver Provisioning: Managing remote execution environments Loom CLI The command-line interface that users interact with directly. It: - Maintains a local connection to the server - Provides a REPL for conversations - Executes tools on the local filesystem Weavers Ephemeral execution environments for running agent tasks: - Kubernetes pods with isolated filesystems - Pre-configured with development tools - Automatically cleaned up after use Data Flow 1. User sends a message via CLI 2. CLI forwards to server via WebSocket 3. Server proxies to LLM provider 4. Response streams back through the same path 5. Tool calls may route to local CLI or remote Weaver The server acts as a \"man in the middle\" to enable features like session sharing, audit logging, and usage tracking. State Machine The agent operates as a state machine: | State | Description | |-------|-------------| | Idle | Waiting for user input | | Calling LLM | Sending request to AI provider | | Processing Response | Parsing LLM output | | Executing Tool | Running a tool call | | Complete | Task finished | Transitions are triggered by events like user messages, LLM responses, and tool completions. Design Principles 1. Server-side LLM: The agent logic runs on the server, not in the CLI 2. Streaming First: All responses stream in real-time 3. Tool Isolation: Tools can run locally or remotely 4. Audit Everything: Complete history of all actions"

Before you begin, make sure you have a Loom account, Node.js 20+ installed, and a terminal application. Step 1: Install the CLI Install the Loom CLI using your preferred package manager: Step 2: Authenticate Log in to your Loom account: This will open a browser window for authentication. Step 3: Verify Installation Check that everything is working: Creating Your First Thread A thread is a conversation with the Loom AI agent. Let's create one: The agent will respond with suggestions and code. You can continue the conversation naturally. Use descriptive prompts to get better results. Include context about your project, coding style preferences, and specific requirements. Next Steps"
