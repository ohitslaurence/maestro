# Loom Design System: Visual Motif References

Visual inspiration for the "Threadwork" design system. Review these references and let me know which motifs resonate.

## A. Warp Lines (Vertical Pinstripes)

Subtle vertical lines at low opacity, evoking the parallel warp threads on a loom.

**References:**
- [Pinstripe fabric patterns (Adobe Stock)](https://stock.adobe.com/search?k=pinstripe+pattern) — Classic thin vertical lines
- [Dark blue pinstripe texture](https://stock.adobe.com/images/dark-blue-pinstripe-fabric-texture-background/989385610) — Subtle dark lines on dark background
- [Monochrome diagonal pinstripe](https://stock.adobe.com/images/monochrome-diagonal-pinstripe-pattern-on-dark-fabric-texture-background/1565997886) — Slanted variation
- [Hand-drawn wonky pinstripes](https://stock.adobe.com/images/seamless-hand-drawn-vertical-pinstripe-pattern-made-of-fine-wonky-white-stripes-on-black-background-abstract-simple-classic-blender-motif-with-linocut-print-texture-in-a-trendy-doodle-line-art-style/562896091) — More organic, hand-crafted feel

**Use case:** Page backgrounds, sidebar panels, subtle texture overlays at 3-5% opacity

## B. Crosshatch Texture (Woven Grid)

Intersecting diagonal or perpendicular lines creating a fabric-like woven texture.

**References:**

- [Linen canvas burlap crosshatch](https://stock.adobe.com/images/black-cross-hatch-seamless-texture-diagonal-line-repeated-pattern-surface-rough-sackcloth-fabric-background-crosshatch-linen-canvas-burlap-overlay-wallpaper-vector-textile-backdrop/1180713132) — Rough textile feel
- [White woven fabric close-up](https://stock.adobe.com/images/white-woven-fabric-texture/943434629) — Clean, modern woven
- [Hand-drawn crosshatch pencil patterns](https://stock.adobe.com/images/crosshatch-pattern-texture-set-hand-drawn-pencil-line-wood-rain-stripe-hatch-organic-shape-collection-sketch-vector-illustration/723498323) — Sketchy, organic variations

- [Crosshatch fabric on Spoonflower](https://www.spoonflower.com/en/shop/crosshatch-texture) — Various crosshatch textile designs

**Use case:** Card headers, hover states, selected items, subtle container backgrounds

## C. Thread Dividers (Horizontal Lines)

Single horizontal thread lines as section separators, replacing traditional borders.

**References:**
- [Thread dividers on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/market/thread_divider) — Physical thread organization (conceptual)
- [Warp thread close-up on loom](https://littlelooms.com/express-rigid-heddle-weaving/) — See warp threads stretched across frame
- [Embroidery thread lines](https://fontesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/commit_mono-3.jpg) — Clean parallel lines

**Concept:** A single 1px line (using accent color at 30% opacity) stretching horizontally, perhaps with a small knot or intersection point as a decorative element.

**Use case:** Section separators, between list items, content dividers

## D. Perforated Edges (Punch Card Style)

Small dots or holes along card/container edges, referencing Jacquard loom punch cards and early computing.

**References:**
- [Vintage punch card patterns (Shutterstock)](https://www.shutterstock.com/search/vintage-punched-cards) — Classic perforated data cards
- [Punch card aesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card) — Historical context (Jacquard loom connection!)
- [Perforated card designs (Etsy)](https://www.etsy.com/market/perforated_card) — Modern interpretations
- [Library card with perforated edge](https://www.shutterstock.com/search/vintage-punched-cards) — Kraft paper with circular holes

**Historical note:** The Jacquard loom (1804) used punch cards to control weaving patterns — a direct ancestor of computer programming. This motif connects Loom's coding agent identity to textile history.

**Use case:** Card edges, modal borders, decorative margins

## E. Loom Frame Corners (Decorative Brackets)

L-shaped decorative corner brackets evoking the wooden frame of a traditional loom.

**References:**
- [Vintage frame looms (Etsy)](https://www.etsy.com/market/vintage_frame_loom) — Wooden loom frames
- [The Oxford Frame Loom](https://oxfordweavingstudio.com/products/the-oxford-frame-loom-1) — Modern wooden loom construction

- [Decorative corner brackets (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/decorative-corner-brackets/s?k=decorative+corner+brackets) — Metal bracket styles
- [Art deco corner frames](https://stock.adobe.com/search?k=corner+bracket+frame) — Geometric corner designs

**Concept:** Simple L-shaped lines at corners of hero sections or featured panels, perhaps 2-3px thick in accent or muted color.

**Use case:** Hero sections, featured content panels, modal dialogs, onboarding cards

---

## F. Heddle Tabs (Navigation)

Tab navigation styled like the heddles on a loom — the frames that lift warp threads.

**References:**
- [Heddle close-up photos (Shutterstock)](https://www.shutterstock.com/search/heddle) — Warp threads through heddles
- [Heddle photos (Alamy)](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/heddles.html) — Various heddle frame styles
- [Rigid heddle loom threading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa1WrHOTjxY) — See heddle slots and holes
- [Heddle bar on Oxford Loom](https://oxfordweavingstudio.com/products/the-oxford-frame-loom-1) — Modern heddle bar design
- [Threading heddles discussion](https://janestaffordtextiles.com/forums/topic/thoughts-on-2-4-dressing-your-loom-back-to-front-threading-the-heddles/) — Shows heddle frames in context

**Concept:** Tabs with a raised "slot" or notch at top, vertical lines suggesting the heddle's thread-lifting mechanism. Active tab could have a "thread" running through it.

**Use case:** Main navigation, thread category tabs, filter tabs

## Summary: Motif Combinations

| Combination | Feel | Best For |
|-------------|------|----------|
| **A + C** (Warp Lines + Thread Dividers) | Clean, minimal, modern | Developer-focused, professional |
| **B + D** (Crosshatch + Perforated) | Textured, tactile, historical | Craft-focused, unique identity |
| **A + E + F** (Warp + Frame Corners + Heddle Tabs) | Industrial, structured | Full loom metaphor |
| **C + E** (Thread Dividers + Frame Corners) | Subtle, elegant | Balanced approach |

## Next Steps

Review these references and let me know:
1. Which individual motifs appeal to you (A, B, C, D, E, F)?
2. Which combination feels right for Loom's brand?
3. Any motifs you want to exclude?

Then I'll create the complete design token specification with CSS variables, Tailwind config, and component examples.
